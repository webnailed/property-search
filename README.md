Code was written on a mac using node version 6.9.1

##Thoughts on the test

Test covered a large breadth of front end skills and in that respect was well drafted.  The test was a little longer than i have seen - I spent around 9 hours on it - but I enjoyed it mostly.  The BDD features made it the requirements explain themselves.
